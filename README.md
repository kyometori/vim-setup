# Vim Setup
This repository is my own vim setups. Feel free to copy anything if you like or you want to try these settings.

## Vundle
I use [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) as my plugin manager. If you just copy and use my `.vimrc` you have to download Vundle to manage all other plugins.

You can follow [their quick start guide](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) to install Vundle. After that run `:PluginInstall` or any other method you learn from their documentation to install all the plugins. Everything should work except YouCompleteMe.

### You Complete Me
**You Complete Me** is an autocomplete plugin for vim. It's also known as the hardest plugin to be installed on the vim.

If you don't want to use it, please remove that line in the `.vimrc`.

I won't tell you how to install it correctly because I don't even know but it just worked. Please follow any other reliable guide you found.
