# Vim Setup
This repository is my own vim setups. Feel free to copy anything if you like or you want to try these settings.

## vim-plug
I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as my plugin manager. If you just copy and use my `.vimrc` you have to download vim-plug to manage all other plugins.

You can follow [their installation guide](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to install vim-plug (basically just one line of shell command). After that run `:PlugInstall` or any other method you learn from their documentation to install all the plugins.

# Contributing
Don't open pull request and ruin my setup.

If I don't like the changes I'll just close or ignore the pull request since it would directly affect my editor.
